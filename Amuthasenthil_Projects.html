                            <li>Class: Computer Science/Software Engineering</li>

                            <li>Objective: In the Scratch Project we had two weeks to 
                                program a game through Scratch, in which the player could 
                                influence what would occur in the game. My responsibility in the project 
                                was to program the first two levels of the game as well as creating 
                                its plot. Through this project my coding and programming skills 
                                became greatly enhanced, since creating several aspects of the program was my
                                responsibility. Along with the coding, I had to create a organized project
                                notebook, which improved my organization and efficiency. As a result of our 
                                hard work, we received a 98% on this project.</li>

                            <li>Objective: In the Image Artist Project, we were tasked with manipulating four images of through Python,
                                in order to advocate for a certain cause. My role in the project was to help program the code for creating the 
                                border as well as creating and maintaining a project log. As a result from the Image Artist Project, I gained extensive
                                knowledge regarding photo manipulation in Python, I also improved my teamwork and time management skills by relaying all 
                                changes to my partner as well as by creating and abiding by a strict project schedule. Through cooperation, communication, and abiding
                                by project norms, we were able to accomplish the objective in an efficient manner.</li>

                            <li>Objective: In the College App^2 Project, we were tasked with creating a functional appliccation on Android Studio. Each teamwork
                            had the freedom to create an app to serve a function of their choosing. We chose to create a appliccation that would help students
                            complete the stressful and time consuming process of applying to colleges. We had to create a documentation using google documents, 
                            create previews of the app on Proto.io, as well as complete the fully functional appliccation and push the appliccation to github. 
                            My role in this project as the Project Manager was to allocate responsibilities, ensure that everyone was on task, finish the docmentation
                            as well as the presentation, and provide any aid I could when it came to coding the app on Android Studio and creating the prototype 
                            of the appliccation on Proto.io</li>

                            had the freedom to create an app to serve a function of their choosing. We chose to create a appliccation that would help people find 
                            a quiet space to study. Study spaces such as Starbucks are often too busy and finding seats can be difficult
                            as a result our app ranks similar cafes based on wait times, quality of food, etc.The app We had to create a documentation using google documents, 
                            conduct peer interviews, as well as complete the fully functional appliccation and push the appliccation to github. 
                            My role in this project as the head documentor on this project consisted of conducting peer interviews, updating the documentation,
                            finshing the presentation and keeping track of the scrumlist. </li>
