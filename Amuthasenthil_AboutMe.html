                        <p style="font-size: 22px" >Hello, my name is Pranav Amuthasenthil, welcome to my online portfolio.   I am currently a Senior 
                           at Dublin High School, and a member of the Project Lead the Way Engineering Academy. Through courses such as Intro 
                           to Engineering Design, Principles of Engineering, and Computer Science Software Engineering, I have been exposed to a wide 
                           variety of engineering aspects.  I love engineering and would be a dedicated, reliable, and hardworking employee to my employer.  
                           After graduating from high school I plan, to go to an engineering university and earn a master's degree in Computer Science 
                           Engineering.  At Dublin High School I have played football for 4 years, ran track for two years, and participated in the California 
                           Scholarship Federation for 4 years, these activities have made me a focused, hardworking, and determined individual.  </p> 
                        <p style="font-size: 22px">Through participating in various engineering camps and clubs I have obtained a vast knowledge over various 
                           engineering aspects.  In my time at Dublin High School I have won three athletic scholar certificates, been Autodesk Inventor Pro 
                           2014 certified, and have been accepted into the Engineering Academy.  Through taking place in all of these activities I have 
                           gained extensive knowledge in multiple engineering aspects such as coding, modeling, and building.  I am an independent, strong, 
                           and resourceful engineering student with refined time management skills.  To conclude, as a result of participating in various 
                           high school sports and activities I have become an extremely knowledgeable young man.  If you would like to contact me, please 
                           visit the CONTACT ME page in my portfolio.Thank you.  </p>
